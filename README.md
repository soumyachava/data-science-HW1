# Python Assignment

This repository contains solutions to a series of Python programming problems that were part of my assignment. The problems focused on improving my skills with loops, recursion, lists, and handling edge cases.

## Tasks Completed

Here is a list of the problems I solved:

### 1. Reverse Elements in a List
- **Task**: Write two functions to reverse the order of elements in a list. One using a loop and the other using list comprehension.
- **What I did**: I created two different functions to reverse a list, each using a different approach.

### 2. Combine Two Lists by Alternating Elements
- **Task**: Combine two lists by alternating elements from the end of the first list and the beginning of the second.
- **What I did**: I used loops and list slicing to alternate between the two lists and combine them in the required way.

### 3. Convert a Number to a List of Digits
- **Task**: Write two functions that take a number and return a list of its digits.
- **What I did**: I created two functionsâ€”one that uses a loop to extract digits and the other using list comprehension.

### 4. Sum of Elements in a List
- **Task**: Write four functions to sum the numbers in a list using different methods: for-loop, while-loop, and recursion (two versions).
- **What I did**: I wrote four different ways to sum the numbers, as required in the problem, each using different logic and techniques.

### 5. Rolling Mean of Piano Practice Minutes
- **Task**: Write a function that calculates the rolling average over `k` days of piano practice minutes. Some days may have missing data (represented by `None`).
- **What I did**: I created a function that calculates the average while ignoring missing data, handling edge cases like missing values in the list.

### 6. Pell Numbers Sequence
- **Task**: Write a function that generates the first `n` Pell numbers and stores them in an empty list.
- **What I did**: I implemented the Pell number sequence using the given formula and stored the numbers in the list.

### 7. Filter Strings Alphabetically
- **Task**: Write a function that filters out strings from a list that come alphabetically before a given test string.
- **What I did**: I implemented a function that goes through a list of strings and keeps only the ones that come after the given string in alphabetical order.

### 8. Recursive Functions for List Operations
- **Task**: Write recursive functions to handle list operations like summing numbers, without using slicing.
- **What I did**: I wrote recursive functions to sum the elements of a list and handle different edge cases.

### 9. Debugging and Improving Code
- **Task**: Debug several Python problems with logical errors or missing edge case handling.
- **What I did**: I focused on fixing the bugs and improving the code, making sure it works correctly for all cases.

## Tools and Resources Used

- **GeeksforGeeks**: I used GeeksforGeeks to understand some basic concepts, but I wrote all the code myself. I did not copy any code directly from the site.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: I used Jupyter Notebook for writing, testing the code and debugging.

## Conclusion

This assignment helped me practice Python, especially loops, recursion, and handling edge cases. I learned how to solve problems step by step and handle missing data in lists, which made me more confident in my problem-solving skills.
